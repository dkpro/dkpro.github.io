This project was initiated by the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP) at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany under the auspices of Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych.

### What is DKPro?

*DKPro* was created as the *Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Repository* and first presented at the GSCL 2007. DKPro is a community that consists of a growing number of projects addressing different aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), e.g. linguistic pre-processing, machine learning, lexical resources, etc. The projects within DKPro maintain a strong contact with each other, share a common ideaology of reusability, and often build upon each other.

### Who is developing DKPro?

For a long time, DKPro has been exclusively developed by the members of the UKP Lab. Later, members of the Language Technology Lab, Universität Duisburg-Essen joined in. Since 2014, DKPro opened up to become a community project and has adopted a contributor license agreement approach to contributions.

**We would like to thank all those who contribute or have contributed to DKPro!**
