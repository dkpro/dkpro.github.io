This project was initiated by the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP) at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany under the auspices of Prof. Iryna Gurevych.

### What is DKPro?

DKPro is a community that consists of a growing number of projects addressing different aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), e.g. linguistic pre-processing, machine learning, lexical resources, etc. The projects within DKPro maintain a strong contact with each other, share a common ideology of reusability, and often build upon each other.

*DKPro* was created as the *Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Repository* and first presented at the GSCL 2007. As part of becoming a community project, it was decided to drop the old long name. Presently, we continue to use *DKPro* as a neutral brand without any long form.

It is not uncommon for people to use *DKPro* and *DKPro Core* synonymously. However, they are not the
same. *DKPro* is a community that incorporates multiple projects and *DKPro Core* is but one of these
projects. Also, no all projects in the DKPro community are based on UIMA, but DKPro Core is.

As the different DKPro projects are mainly developed by scientists, please cite them individually
based on which of the projects you use. There is presently no citation regarding the overarching DKPro community effort. If you wish to refer to the DKPro community as a whole, please just link to our website: https://dkpro.github.io

### Who is developing DKPro?

For a long time, DKPro has been exclusively developed by the members of the UKP Lab. Later, members of the Language Technology Lab, Universität Duisburg-Essen joined in. Since 2014, DKPro opened up to become a community project and has adopted a contributor license agreement approach to contributions.

**We would like to thank all those who contribute or have contributed to DKPro!**
