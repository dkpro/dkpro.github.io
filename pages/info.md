This project was initiated by the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP) at Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany under the auspices of Prof. Iryna Gurevych.

### What is DKPro?

DKPro is a community that consists of a growing number of projects addressing different aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as linguistic pre-processing, machine learning, and lexical resources. The projects within DKPro maintain strong contacts with each other, share a common ideology of reusability, and often build upon each other.

*DKPro* was created as the *Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Repository* and first presented at the 2007 Conference of the German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL 2007). As part of becoming a community project, it was decided to drop the old long name. Presently, we use the *DKPro* brand without any long form.

It is not uncommon for people to use *DKPro* and *DKPro Core* synonymously. However, they are not the
same. *DKPro* is a community that incorporates multiple projects and *DKPro Core* is but one of these
projects. Also, not all projects in the DKPro community are based on UIMA, but DKPro Core is.

As the different DKPro projects are mainly developed by scientists, please cite them individually
based on which of the projects you use. There is presently no citation regarding the overarching DKPro community effort. If you wish to refer to the DKPro community as a whole, please just link to our website: https://dkpro.github.io

### Who develops DKPro?

For a long time, DKPro was exclusively developed by the members of the UKP Lab. Later, members of the Language Technology Lab at the University of Duisburg-Essen joined in. In 2014, DKPro opened up to become a community project and adopted a contributor license agreement approach for contributions.

**We would like to thank all those who contribute or have contributed to DKPro!**
